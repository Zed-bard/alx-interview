## Installation

Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

To clone the repository, run:
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <repository_directory>
```

## Usage

To use the UTF-8 validation script, create a Python file named `0-validate_utf8.py` and implement the `validUTF8` function, which takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if the data is valid UTF-8, otherwise `False`.

## Testing

This project uses Python's built-in doctest module for testing.

To run the tests, execute the following command in your terminal:
```fish
#!/usr/bin/env fish
python3 -m doctest -v (basename (status -f))
exit
```

The `doctest` module will validate the examples provided in the docstrings and print the test results.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the `validUTF8` function:

```python
>>> validUTF8 = __import__('0-validate_utf8').validUTF8
>>> print(validUTF8([65]))
True

>>> print(validUTF8([80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 32, 99, 111, 111, 108, 33]))
True

>>> print(validUTF8([229, 65, 127, 256]))
False
```
